            Two years following the tragic death of President Abraham Lincoln, after being sponsored by Bigelow Lodge No. 243,
            a dispensation was granted by Grand Master Thomas Sparrow on March 28th, 1867.
            Two days later, Forest City Lodge U.D. held its first meeting in the Masonic Hall on Franklin Street, and adopted a code of By-Laws.

        As Cleveland grew and changed, so did its members change and relocate about the city.
        In time, the number of East Side members was so predominant that a vote was held in November of 1873,
        which resulted in the meeting place being moved to Case Hall, located at East 3rd Street and Superior Avenue.
        This location remained our home for almost a quarter of a century.

        The depression inflicted heavy financial losses upon many of our members, and many would have been suspended for non-payment of dues.
        The Brethren of Forest City Lodge demonstrated their Masonic Charity, and all worthy, distressed members during those years, and right up to the present time, were kept in good standing.

        With the merger of Golden Square, Forest City Lodge became the owner of 75% of the shares of the Shaker Masonic Temple.
        Lodge consolidations and the movement of tenants to other Masonic facilities had the Shaker Masonic Temple looking for other tenants.
        Unity Church became a prime tenant, but this income was not sufficient to lessen the financial burden that Forest City had to bear as the majority owner.
        In 1999, Unity Church approached the building association about buying the facility.
        After lengthy negotiations, the sale was approved and Forest City Lodge moved as a tenant to the Lyndhurst Masonic Center, located at 5516 Mayfield Road, Lyndhurst, Ohio 44124.
